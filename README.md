# Roadmap
- Recipe overview (as a step before the actual step-by-step guide) [UI]
- Go back to CategoryList

# Future Stack
- Wakeword powered by: Porcupine (talk to sales)
- Speech-to-text powered by Google Cloud
- Text-To-Speech powered by Google Cloud

# Stuff to remember
- Picovoice/Porcupine: WASM word files currently can't be generated with open source tools (you need to contact sales so they create a model for you)
        - Astonishing results, could even be used standalone if enough keyword files
- PocketSphinx
    - Very low treshold, difficult to use as wakeword
- Snowboy
    - No WASM port yet
- Precise
    - ???
